You will write a C program that will play a letter guessing game.General Requirements Write a program that reads letters from a file called“lettersin.txt”. Your program will ask the user to enter the number of games they wish to play (1 to 4) Your program will open the lettersin.txt file read in one character at a time and repeat this for thenumber of games the user wants to play. For this assignment the test file will contain letters, all lowercase When the number of games has been played, the program will end A sample of an input file that you can use to test your program is included with the assignment. A preprocessor directive must be used to define the maximum number of guesses as 5 If the player has used up all of their guesses, a message that the game is over should be displayedalong with the letter they were trying to guess. You must have at least 4 user defined functions as follows://this function provides instructions to the user on how to play the gamevoid GameRules( );//this function runs one entire game. It for checks either 5 incorrect guesses or a correct guess.//It returns a 0 if the game is over and the player did not guess the letter, otherwise it returns 1.int SingleGame(char file_letter);//this function prompts the player to make a guess and returns that guess//this function is called from inside the SingleGame( ) function described abovechar RetrieveGuess( );//this function takes two arguments, the guess from the player//and the solution letter from the file.//It lets the user know if the guess comes alphabetically before or after the answer//The function returns 1 if the guess matches the solution and returns a 0 if they do not match//this function is called from inside the OneGame( ) function described aboveint GuessedIt(char answer, char input_letter);Additional Requirements: Use function prototypes. Write comments for each function that will appear in the file before each prototype andagain before each function definition. Be sure to comment your code adequately. Be sure to indent properly. Check your textbook and lecture code examples to see how it shouldbe done. Use meaningful variable names Check all requirements list on Blackboard before submittingSample Output:Welcome to the Letter Guessing GameYou will enter the number of games you want to play (1 – 4 games)You have 5 chances to guess each letterLet’s begin:——————————–How many games do you want to play (1-4) 3************************************Let’s play game 1Enter a guess: ethe letter you are trying to guess comes before eEnter a guess: cthe letter you are trying to guess comes before cEnter a guess: aYou guessed it!!!************************************Let’s play game 2Enter a guess: tthe letter you are trying to guess comes before tEnter a guess: athe letter you are trying to guess comes after aEnter a guess: pthe letter you are trying to guess comes before pEnter a guess: nthe letter you are trying to guess comes before nEnter a guess: gthe letter you are trying to guess comes after gYou did not guess the letter.
